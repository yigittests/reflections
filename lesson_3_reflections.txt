When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    Making a remote repository makes it possible to work on the same project with other people all around the world.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Maybe I want to keep all those changes online until I really need to work with
	them on my local machine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is made when you have no permission to collaborate one's repository. You
    instead form their repository and clone it to your account and work on that
    clone. But you can clone your own local repositories in a different location
    or you can clone your GitHub repositories as well. Branch is made only when 
    you want to commit a change but you don't want that change to be in the final 
    product yet. In that case you create a new branch and keep it separate from the original one.
